          <p>
            The advanced settings are activated by clicking on the ‘Advanced

            Threshold (CCT), Salience Threshold (ST), and Word Count
            Threshold(WCT) . The default values for: CCT is 3, ST is 0.2, and
            WCT is 1. You can choose to create the project with the default
            values or change these values which will affect what the default
            values will be for the reports made in the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once all the information is entered (the Project Name and Location
            are required fields) click “Save” and the project is created.

          <p>
            When a project is made, you can create a report with the “Create

          <div class="pareto-documentation__flex-container">

                In the standard settings fill out or choose the following
                information: Report Name, URL (*optional), Keyword, Location,
                Language, Search Engine, and Scrape Frequency.
              </p>
              <p>
                *The URL can be added later. The default location, language, and
                search engine are taken from the ‘Project settings’. The default
                Scrape Frequency is set to<b> “Paused” </b>so you need to adjust
                this to the frequency you would prefer.

            Creating a Report - Without a URL
          </h3>
          <p>
            To create a report without a URL, enter a Report Name, a Keyword,
            and a Location. The Keyword, Location, and Search Engine cannot be
            changed after making a report. The other settings have default
            values inherited from the project which can be changed in the report
            form. A URL can be added later after making the report.
          </p>
          <h4 id="competitors-table">Competitors Table</h4>
          <p>
            When the report is finished, the first thing you see when you open
            it is the competitors table. Here we can see the first 20 URLs which
            respond to the Keyword, Language, Location, and Search Engine
            entered to create the report with additional data.
          </p>
          <h5 id="check-the-recommended-competitors">
            <i> Check the recommended competitors </i>
          </h5>
          <p>
            The next step is to check the recommended competitor URLs (the
            default is 8) which have been selected. If necessary, you can select
            additional or deselect chosen competitors to edit the report and the
            results in the entities table will update accordingly. To change the
            selection, click on the boxes next to the competitors as in the
            picture.
          </p>
          <img style="max-width: 914px" src="images/image17.png" />

          </h5>
          <div class="pareto-documentation__flex-container">
            <p>
              After checking and/or editing the competitor selection, the next
              step is checking and adjusting the extracted text. To access the
              extracted text for a competitor and edit it, click on the “Render
              Window” button to open the render window:
            </p>
            <img style="max-width: 102px" src="images/image13.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The render window shows a screenshot of the URL which was scraped,
            and a panel on the right side with controls and information. To
            access and edit the extracted text, click on the ‘Edit Extracted
            Text’ checkbox in the right panel, as seen in the image below (1).
            This opens the text editor (Extracted Text) where we can see and
            edit the text which was extracted.
          </p>
          <img src="/images/image7.png" />
          <p>
            After making the desired changes, click on ‘Save Extracted Text’
            (2), and the report will update the information for the competitor
            and the report. A notification shows that the report has been
            updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The
            <b> headers used by the competitor </b>
            will be grouped at the top in the extracted text editor.
          </p>
          <h4 id="entities-table">Entities Table</h4>
          <p>
            After checking and editing the extracted text, it is time to move on
            to the entities section. There we can see a list of entities that
            satisfy the parameters previously set for the report (Competitor
            Count Threshold, Salience Threshold, and Word Count Threshold). The
            entities section contains two tables, Timestamp Entities and Report
            Entities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Timestamp Entities table shows a list of entities with
            preselected entities based on recommended competitors and the report
            threshold values (full yellow stars).
          </p>
          <img src="images/image22.png" />
          <p>
            This table also shows
            <b> “Heading Average Frequency” </b>
            which tells us how often competitors used these entities on average,
            across different heading styles (H1/H2/H3).
          </p>
          <h5 id="check-recommended-entities-and-adjust-the-selections">
            <i>
              Check recommended entities and adjust the selections (use filters)

          <div class="pareto-documentation__flex-container">
            <img style="max-width: 700px" src="images/image1.png" />
            <p>
              We can then additionally filter out entities by Competitor Count,
              Average Salience, and Entity Word Count. This shows other entities
              which were select by the predefined parameters an we can select or
              deselect additional report entities:
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            To add entities to the selection click on the empty stars. To review
            the final selection of entities, go to the Report Entities table.
            There we can deselect entities by clicking on the full yellow stars.
          </p>
          <h4 id="content-editor">Content Editor</h4>
          <p>
            Following the finalization of entity inspection and selection, the
            next step is going to the ‘Content Editor’. This features a text
            editor where we write our content with basic writing tools and a
            right side panel which provides: a live content score, headings
            counter (with a recommended average of h1, h2 and h3 headings), word
            counter and recommended entities.
          </p>
          <img src="images/image33.png" />
          <h5

              possible to 100
            </i>
          </h5>
          <p>
            In the Content Editor, we should write the content following the
            guidelines within the sidebar. By following the guidelines, the
            content score will go up. It is recommendable to get as close as
            possible to a 100. The right sidebar of the Content Editor has two
            sections where can see the guidelines based off of the report data
            which was collected and reviewed.
          </p>
          <div class="pareto-documentation__flex-container">
            <img src="images/image12.png" />
            <p>
              In the first section there is a save button to save the content
              created in the content editor. Just under it is the Content Score
              meter and counters for Average H1 uses, Average H2 uses, Average
              H3 uses, Average Word Count, and Average Image Count.
            </p>

          <div class="pareto-documentation__flex-container">
            <p>
              The second is the Entities section which is split into two
              categories.
              <span>
                Starting with “Terms in headers”. Here are the entity
                recommendations for the headers. These trackers show
                recommendations for entities to be used in headers. We can see
                which header was used next to each entity. Headers are grouped
                by usage. If one entity is used in every header then it will
                show “h1/h2/h3” but if it only wasn’t used in H1, then the
                header would have “h2/h3” tags. Headers contribute the most
                points when they include entities from this section.
              </span>
            </p>

            <p>
              Hovering over an entity in the ‘Terms in headers’ shows a tooltip.
              This tooltip shows the usage data for this entity as a header
              across the competitors. Clicking on the competitor (arranged by
              rank) will open their respective render pages. Here we can inspect
              the headers used by the competitor.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="pareto-documentation__flex-container">
            <p>
              Below “Terms in headers” we can see “Terms in text”. Next to each
              entity is a tracker which tracks each use of an entity in the
              entire text, headers included. The range to the right is the
              targeted count for an entity based on the average entity
              frequency. This range is the ‘green zone’, which represents +-20%
              of the average frequency across competitors. The tracker becomes
              GREEN when we hit this target. The tracker is ORANGE when the
              number of uses is +-40% of the average frequency. Finally, the
              tracker is RED when the number of uses is greater than +40% of the
              average frequency. Red indicates overuse of the entity. The
              entities in “Terms in text” also have a tooltip which shows usage
              of an entity across competitors and other data taken from the
              entities table. Clicking on the checkbox next to an entity
              manually marks the entity as optimized.

            By achieving the suggested targets from the counters for Average H1
            count, Average H2 count, Average H3 count, Average Word Count, and
            the entity suggestions in the “Terms in headers” and “Terms in text”
            sections - the Content Score goes up. If the content goes above the
            recommended values, the Content Score goes down. When all values are
            met the content score reaches 100.

            <p>
              Next we take the generated content and add it to our website and
              publish. After it is online we take the URL of our site and add it
              to the report. To do this, open the report, click on ‘Edit’ to
              open the edit section (1). Paste the link in the URL text field

              Then the report will pick up the changes with the next timestamp
              and we can track the results and make adjustments to the content
              over time. Adding a URL to a report enables a new button in the

              To create a report with a targeted URL, you need to additionally

              steps as when creating a report without a URL. Check the
              competitor selection, check the extracted text, as well as check
              and adjust the selection of entities where necessary.

            The entities table does show more information for a report with a
            URL. It shows the average count of entities among competitors in
            comparison to the usage of the same entities in the report URL. The
            top bar indicates the average frequency of an entity across
            competitors, and the bottom bar indicates the average entity
            frequency for the report URL. It is advisable to take notice of
            these differences when finalizing entity selection as overused and

            For the bottom bar, GREEN indicates the entity is optimized. ORANGE
            indicates ‘medium optimization’. RED indicates ‘No Optimization’
            (when the entity is underused or overused). This information is also
            shown in the Entity deviation chart which shows the status of the
            entity over time.

              In this example the report had collected information 4 times. The
              entity “need” was not scraped once out of 4 times and was marked
              as “Entity is missing” for 25% of total times the report was run.

            Regarding updating and optimizing the content from the report URL,
            copying the content from our page to the content editor and making
            adjustments to it is done manually. The content can be copied by
            clicking the “Pull report page content” button (1). This pulls the
            content from the report URL to the content editor. Or we can also
            pull content by putting a URL in the ‘Enter URL’ text field and
            clicking the “Try to auto import article text” button, if the
            content is not on the report URL (2). Otherwise the content can be
            directly from documents.

              A report with a URL will also have a tracker for when content is
              created in the Content Editor (1) and a tracker for when the
              content from the content editor was published on the report
              URL(2).

              When content is edited a date and time will appear next to
              ‘Content Updated At:’. Once content has been optimized and copied
              from the Content Editor to the URL, the report will pick up the
              changes the next time the report performs a scrape. This updates
              the SERP Score for the report URL and adds a date and time next to
              ‘Content Published at:’. Alternatively, we can spend a couple of
              credits and click on the re-scrape button (3) which would update
              the SERP score and check if the content was published. If the
              updated content isn’t detected for any reason, we can manually
              update the ‘Content Published At’ date by clicking the edit button
              next to it (4).

              If the content is updated after it is published a small warning
              sign will appear to warn us the content is out of sync. This
              warning has a little tooltip to remind us that the content is out

          <h4 id="alerts">Alerts</h4>
          <p>
            Once the report is made and the content is updated, a good idea
            would be to create alerts for the report and email notifications.
          </p>
          <div class="pareto-documentation__flex-container">
            <img src="images/image14.png" />
            <p>
              The first step is to create the alerts by clicking on the ‘Alerts’
              section. The first time there will be a form to create your first
              Alert. In the ‘Create Alert’ form fill out and make choices for:
              Name, Alert Type, Metric, Comparison Operator, and Threshold. The
              system supports alerts for Competitors and Entities.

            <p>
              The first step is to choose ‘Competitor’ under Alert Type, this
              will also show a new selection field called “Competitors” (showing
              all the competitors from the competitors table). Next choose
              ‘Rank’ for Metric. After that, choose the competitor whose rank
              you want to track. Following that, select one of the available
              Comparison Operators (Above/ Below/ Between/ Deviation Threshold).
              Finally, enter a value for the ‘Threshold’.
              <span>
                If the Comparison Operator is ‘Between’ then two values
                (From/To) must be entered. Once all of the fields have been
                filled out, click Save. A notification shows that the Alert was
                made.

            <p>
              To make an alert for an entity, choose ‘Entity’ under Alert Type,
              this will show a new selection field called “Entities” (which
              shows all the entities from the report entities table). Next,
              choose a metric to track, “Frequency” or “Salience”. After that,
              choose an entity to track. Following that, selects one of the
              available Comparison Operators (Above/ Below/ Between/ Deviation
              Threshold). Finally, enter the desired value under threshold and
              click Save.

            notification click on the ‘Notifications’ section in the report. The
            first time you will see a form to create your first Alert
            Notification. After creating it, there will be a table which shows
            all of the created notifications.

              notification shows that the Alert Notification was made.
              <span>
                It’s possible to add more than one alert by clicking on ‘+ Add

                logical operators for the notifications with multiple alerts.

              By clicking on the ‘Show Logical Operators?’ checkbox, the
              Operator selection boxes appear for each Alert. The available
              operators are “OR” and “AND”. By default all alerts have an “OR”
              operator. To add more Alert Notifications after the first one,
              click on the ‘Create Notification’ button in the Notifications
              section and follow the same steps as mentioned above.
