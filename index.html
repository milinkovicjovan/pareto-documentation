              The Timestamp Entities table shows a list of entities with

            </p>

              The other steps are the same steps as when creating a report
              without a URL. Check the competitor selection, check the extracted

              necessary.

              The entities table does show more information for a report with a
              URL. It shows the average count of entities among competitors in
              comparison to the usage of the same entities in the report URL.
              The top bar indicates the average frequency of an entity across
              competitors, and the bottom bar indicates the average entity
              frequency for the report URL. It is advisable to take notice of
              these differences when finalizing entity selection as overused and
              underused entities are good candidates to be optimized.

            <p class="mb-4 pb-2">
              For the bottom bar, GREEN indicates the entity is optimized.
              ORANGE indicates ‘medium optimization’. RED indicates ‘No
              Optimization’ (when the entity is underused or overused). This
              information is also shown in the Entity deviation chart which
              shows the status of the entity over time.

              In this example the report had collected information 4 times. The
